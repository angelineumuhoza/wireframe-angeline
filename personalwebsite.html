				<p>Welcome to My personal site! My name is Angeline Umuhoza. I'm a 4th year biology major in the school or arts and sciences. I joined the HackCville web design program becuase over the summer I suddenly woke up and wanted to code:) I'm sure people have decided to do things for less right? </p>

 	<div class = "Title2">Personal Goals
 	<p>My personal goal during this year is to obviously graduate but also get a job to start me on my path to becoming a PA and going to PA school. As this is my last upcoming summer as an undergrad I feel the need to do something that as a full fledged adult I probably won't be able to do once I'm actually out in the real world.  </p>
